# groban-detector-app
Some people have said I look like Josh Groban, so I built a janky ML image classifier to test this out.

Upload an image and see whether the model thinks.

Credit to the fast.ai course for teaching me how to do this.

The model is deployed via huggingface. At some point I'll come back here and post the Jupyter Notebook I used for training the model.
